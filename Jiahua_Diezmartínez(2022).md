Diezmartínez and Short Gianotti (2022) collected and coded the most recent climate action plan for 100 largest cities in the US (by population) and categorized the cities into three categories: (1) cities that do not articulate justice as a core feature of their climate plan; (2) cities that articulate justice as an aspiration; and (3) cities that are explicitly planning for justice. The predictors are a set of cities’ local sociodemographic, economic, and political factors. This data was obtained from the 2019 US Census estimates and the 2015–2019 American Community Survey. They also control for the year of publication, whether it is focused on climate change, whether it is the city’s first plan and whether it mentioned engaging with local community members for the climate plan. They found that publication of the climate action plans is a significant determinant of cities’ level of engagement with justice, from which they conclude that US cities are increasingly integrating justice into climate planning. They also found population size, median household income, coastal cities increase the likelihood of cities incorporating justice into their climate action plans, which percentage of POC may decrease the likelihood. Besides the model, the paper provides an overarching framework for classifying action level in justice in city’s climate plan.

It will be interesting to replicate this study because I found it a unique way of quantifying trend in policy. It does include some geographical information in the model (i.e. coastal city or not) but no other geographical process is considered. I wonder if mapping the cities will point us to other patterns/processes that are not considered by the current model. I am also interested in seeing whether ordinal logistic regression is a good model for this research question and what will the result looks like if we use a binary logistic model. The variables are selected through forward and backward stepwise regression, whose validity might worth some examination. Although this paper describes a general national trend in justice and is not widely cited, it might be used to support future efforts in climate adaption in cities and guide national funding distribution.

Methods: Ordinal logistic regression
Method Description: The methods appear to be adequately described in the study.
Data and Code Availability: Both data and code are available.
Value: Internal validity check, implications for adaptation funding policy.
