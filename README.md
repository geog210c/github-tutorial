# Managing access
In a Github organization, we want to manage privacy settings so that
students can access all of the relevant material but not necessarily
make that material available to users outside of the
organizations. The best practice for accomplishing this is to create a
[team](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations) of all users
(students) that you want to grant access to. Then, when creating such
a repository, make the default setting private, but then add the team
as collaborators through the repository settings, and adjust
permissions as necessary. This allows students full access to the
repository but does not open access to the general public.
